# Fetch Rewards Analytics Engineering Challenge Documentation

## Overview
This repository contains my solution to the Fetch Rewards Analytics Engineering coding challenge. The challenge involves analyzing receipt, user, and brand data to derive business insights and address data quality concerns.

## Data Sources
The analysis uses three primary raw JSON data sources (from a MongoDB source):
1. **Receipts Data**: Contains transaction information including points earned, items purchased, and receipt status
